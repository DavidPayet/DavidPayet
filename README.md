Hi ✌🏼, I'm David
=================

### I aspire to become a proficient IT developer, focused so far on the front-end side. However, I am eager to broaden my expertise by delving into back-end development. Consequently, I am actively looking for work-study opportunity in Bordeaux starting in September, where I can further cultivate my skills as an application designer-builder.
